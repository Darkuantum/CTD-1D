Minigame 1:

Scenario:
This game is aimed with the ojective of raising awareness on different mental illnesses through the trial of gaming. This is to help raise awareness for people and to give an insight on how certain mental illnesses can affect an individual. This software will be providing 3 different mini-games. Our reason for this game is our friend Justin























 who has a problem with dealing with his vices. He is unable to understand how his vices are destroying his physical and mental health, as well as his loved ones around him. Hence, we aim to give him a better understanding of his actions.
Description of the game:
This game is themed towards three addictions, specifically smoking/vaping, gambling and alcohol. The manner of the game is a Q/A structure with yes/no questions. To make it challenging and fun, each addiction scenario takes the form of a monster, and the player will have limited lives while 'battling them'. Each wrong answer will also give a surprise debuff to the players ability to answer the next question, and getting it correct will remove the debuff. If all lives are lost, the player will lose against the monsters and can retry the game.
