## Description game























 who has a problem with dealing with his vices. He is unable to understand how his vices are destroying his physical and mental health, as well as his loved ones around him. Hence, we aim to give him a better understanding of his actions.
Description of the game:
This game is themed towards three addictions, specifically smoking/vaping, gambling and alcohol. The manner of the game is a Q/A structure with yes/no questions. To make it challenging and fun, each addiction scenario takes the form of a monster, and the player will have limited lives while 'battling them'. Each wrong answer will also give a surprise debuff to the players ability to answer the next question, and getting it correct will remove the debuff. If all lives are lost, the player will lose against the monsters and can retry the game.

## Description of mini-game 2

Mini-game 2 runs through a set of words that requires the player to memorise within a time limit, afterwards the words will appear and the user will have to type them in order. This is to help replicate the short term memory of a patient with Alzhimer which is directly linked to dementia. Each time the player gets the answer correct, it will go down a list of harder words based of the initial difficulty they have chosen.
